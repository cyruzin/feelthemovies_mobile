# Feel the Movies Mobile

This is the mobile app from Feel the Movies project.

### Install

First setup your environment with XCODE, Android Studio, JAVA, React Native Cli and other dependencies. Then inside the project folder:

```sh
yarn install
```

### Run

With your device or emulator ready, inside the project folder run the following commands:

For Android

```sh
react-native run-android
```
For iOS

```
react-native run-ios
```
Since I don't have a MAC to test iOS version, maybe you'll find some errors to fix.
